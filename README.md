# RshinyApp_project
In this project I am trying to show the Rshiny app dashboard using some PK data from R and also some synthetic data of il13 inhibition unit concentrations. 
In this project I have tried to show a doshboard of the summary of my combined data as a_theoph.
Also characterize and provide a brief written summary of the data stratified by gender and include characterization of peak concentrations.
Show AUC (based on the linear trapezoidal rule) to a_Theoph.  Complete the function trapezoid() included in the calc_auc code chunk to calculate the column with AUC per subject in a_Theoph.  The function code was started but needs completion and one or more corrections may be needed.  The result of the corrected trapezoid() function must be the a_Theoph data frame with the new column called AUC.  There are various packages with functions available for AUC calculation.
Generate plot(s) using the ggplot2 package to help visualize these data and a brief written summary of any observations.  Pay particular attention to showing concentration change over time as this is a PK experiment.
